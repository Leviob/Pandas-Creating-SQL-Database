# Pandas-Creating-SQL-Database
In this project I use SQLite in conjunction with Pandas to create a SQL database from a dataset of Crunchbase investments.

## Dataset 
Crunchbase offers information on startup fundraising. The dataset used in this project was collected using their API. I'm using the dataset from [this github](https://github.com/datahoarder/crunchbase-october-2013) for October 2013.
